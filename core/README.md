# WebScout
ðŸš§ WebScout is under development, and has not yet reached Alpha stage ðŸš§


WebScout is a lightweight site search engine built using Rust and TypeScript that is optimized for serverless architecture and can run on the edge. Some of the key features of WebScout include:

 - Search algorithm built on statistical and probability analysis that enables quick and accurate search through large amounts of documents
 - Multiple indexes stored on KV for low latency retrieval
 - Leveraging Cloudflare infrastructure for a serverless and distributed search
 - Lightweight design that makes it easy to deploy and run on the edge
 - WebScout is designed to work with Cloudflare Workers, using R2 Buckets for storage and KV for the index and caching layer. This allows for a scalable and reliable search solution that can be quickly and easily deployed.

Overall, WebScout is an experimental search engine that's optimized for speed, reliability, and scalability. It's a great choice for anyone who needs a site search for low latency and wants a lightweight solution that can be easily deployed on the edge.
